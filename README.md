# Hand Gesture Recognition for Gaming 🎮🖐️  

A real-time hand gesture recognition program that replaces keyboard controls for computer games. By utilizing **OpenCV** for image processing and an **SVM** classifier for gesture recognition, players can control in-game movements using only their hands.  

## 🔹 How It Works  
📷 Captures live video feed from a webcam  
✋ Detects and segments hands using image processing techniques  
📊 Extracts features and classifies gestures using an **SVM model**  
🎮 Maps recognized gestures to **W, A, S, D** and arrow keys, allowing seamless game control  

## 🕹️ Tested Games  
- *Fireboy and Watergirl*  
- *Duo Survival*  

## 📁 Repository Includes  
✔️ Main Python script for hand tracking and gesture recognition  
✔️ Pre-trained SVM model weights for classification
